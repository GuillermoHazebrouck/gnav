Configuration of FLIGHT GEAR for G-NAV
--------------------------------------

If you want to test the G-NAV computer in a simulated environment 
using Flight Gear, follow these two steps:

SETP 1:
Copy the gnav/Software/etc/gnav_protocol.xml file into the flight gear generic
protocol configuration folder (typically "/usr/share/games/flightgear/Protocol/").

STEP 2:
Launch Flight Gear using the next options:

--generic=socket,out,4,gha_lnx,4000,udp,gnav_protocol

Note that Flight Gear also provides a textbox in the graphic interface to load 
these startup options, so it is not required to use the console.
