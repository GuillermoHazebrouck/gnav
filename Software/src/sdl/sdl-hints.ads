   --  TODO: Make this more robust using more functions and platform specific
   --  packages with error checking on returned values?
   --  Would be nice to have the compiler only allow that which is allowed on
   --  a particular platform.
   --  It would be nice to have the binding test the return values as well,
   --  raising an exception on values that are just wrong for a particular
   --  platform, i.e. direct3d on Linux or Mac? Exception raised!

   --  This is raised when something has gone horribly wrong somewhere,
   --  i.e. setting the wrong hint on a platform that does not allow it.
